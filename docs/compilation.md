# Device-specific Compilation

Once a target device has been selected, the quantum circuit — typically designed
in a device-agnostic fashion that does not account for hardware limitations
(such as a limited gate set or limited connectivity) — must be compiled so that
it actually becomes executable on that device.

Compilation itself is a sequential process consisting of a series of compilation
passes that step-by-step transform the original quantum circuit until it
conforms to the limitations imposed by the target device. Since many of the
underlying problems in compilation are computationally hard, an ever-growing
variety of compilation passes is available across several quantum SDKs and
software tools—each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

As a result of the sheer number of options, choosing the best sequence of
compilation passes for a given application is nearly impossible. Consequently,
most quantum SDKs (such as Qiskit and TKET) provide easy-to-use high-level
function calls that encapsulate _their_ sequence of compilation passes into a
single compilation flow. While this allows convenient circuit compilation, it
has several drawbacks:

- It creates a kind of vendor lock that limits the available compilation passes
  to those provided by the SDK offering the compilation flow.
- The respective compilation flows are designed to be broadly applicable and are
  neither device-specific nor circuit-specific.
- No means are provided to optimize for a customizable figure of merit.

To overcome these limitations, the MQT Predictor framework provides
**device-specific quantum circuit compilers** by combining compilation passes
from various compiler tools and learning optimized sequences of those passes
with respect to a customizable figure of merit. This mix-and-match approach
eliminates vendor lock-in and enables optimized compilers that transcend the
capabilities of individual tools.

The compilation process is modeled as a **Markov Decision Process** and takes
three inputs to train a reinforcement learning (RL) model that acts as a
compiler:

1. Training circuits
2. The targeted quantum device
3. The figure of merit to optimize for

The trained model can then be used to compile any quantum circuit for the
targeted device.

## MDP Strategies

The reinforcement learning environment supports two MDP strategies:

- `v2` is the original MQT Predictor strategy.
- `v3` is the default. It uses a permissive strategy before layout and restricts
  later optimization to actions that preserve the established compilation
  structure.

Select a strategy with the `mdp` parameter of `PredictorEnv`, `Predictor`, or
`rl_compile`, for example `mdp="v2"`.
